I am a Salesforce Developer with more than one year experience. I have always been passionate about programming and everything related to it.

#### So why did I start this blog?
Well, I started this blog to share some thoughts and to make some notes on things connected with cloud computing and the Salesforce Platform especially. I am not going to write a lot, but there are interesting issues which appear in my daily work and I
would be glad to share them with you.

#### Why did I choose cloud computing?
Cloud computing is constantly changing the world in something entirely different. The speed with which cloud computing transforming business models is incredible. That's why I plunged into this technology. That's why I intend to stay with it for a long time.

Today I am working as a Software Engineer at EPAM Systems, a global provider of software engineering and IT consulting services.
